/*
Our soccer team plays a tournament in which it played 10 matches.
Match results are noted "3:0": first number is **our** team's goals count ; the second is the other team's.
To know our team's score, we follow these rules:
- Victory: 3pts
- Draw: 1pt
- Defeat: 0pt
Given an array with our match's results, write a function which will return our score.
To test your function, if you "feed" your function the array under this text, you should get 12 points.
